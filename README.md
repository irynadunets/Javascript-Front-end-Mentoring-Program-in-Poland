- Use ng-cli to create a new project
- Explore the generated project structure

## Angular. Components. Directives & Pipes task

### Task requirements
The main goal of this task is to implement the main page of the YouTube client app.
You are to enrich previously generated components with necessary functionality and markup.

You can use any UI frameworks/libraries to simplify (facilitate) the creation of your markup. It's recommended to use Angular Material as it’s fully integrated with Angular.
